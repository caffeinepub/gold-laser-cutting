  "summary": "Diff adds a single-page React+TS marketing site with black/gold theme, sections for Hero/About/Services/Gallery/Why Choose Us/Testimonials/FAQ/Contact, scroll-reveal animations with reduced-motion handling, and a sticky WhatsApp button. Most requirements appear implemented, but the “Why Choose Us” content cannot be verified as matching the user-provided bullet points exactly (as required).",

      "requirement": "Add a Why Choose Us section containing all six bullet points provided by the user (exactly as listed).",
      "reason": "The diff implements a 6-item Why Choose Us section, but the titles/descriptions are authored content and there is no evidence they match the user-provided bullet points \"exactly as listed\" (the required canonical list is not shown in the diff summary).",
